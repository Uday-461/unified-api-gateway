## 6. Architect Checklist & Validation Report

| Category | Requirement Analysis & Technical Design | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Feasibility** | The proposed architecture is highly feasible. Zuplo is designed for this exact use case (auth, custom logic, proxy). The main complexity lies in the custom TypeScript handlers and robust database interactions. | ✅ **Pass** |
| **Scalability** | Zuplo's serverless edge infrastructure is inherently scalable. The primary bottleneck will be the external PostgreSQL database. A serverless or properly provisioned database is crucial to handle load. | ✅ **Pass** (with DB caution) |
| **Performance** | The PRD requires `<100ms` overhead. The in-path DB reads for auth and pricing will be the biggest latency contributors. This is a **moderate risk**. To mitigate, we must use a DB provider with a region close to the Zuplo edge and optimize queries carefully. Asynchronous writes for logging/billing will prevent them from adding to response latency. | ⚠️ **Risk** |
| **Security** | The design is secure. API keys are hashed in the DB. Secrets (DB connection string) are managed by Zuplo. We can leverage Zuplo's built-in rate-limiting policies to meet the PRD's abuse prevention requirements. | ✅ **Pass** |
| **Maintainability** | Logic is well-partitioned. Zuplo handles infrastructure, the DB holds state, and a separate web app handles the UI. The custom TypeScript code is the main component to maintain, which is standard. | ✅ **Pass**|
| **Observability** | Zuplo provides built-in logging and analytics for traffic. Our custom handlers must include structured logging (e.g., JSON logs to stdout) to provide visibility into the business logic (credit checks, DB errors, etc.). | ✅ **Pass** |
| **Cost** | This is a cost-effective model. We pay for Zuplo requests, database usage, and the web app hosting. This avoids the overhead of managing a custom proxy fleet (e.g., on Kubernetes). | ✅ **Pass**|

### Summary and Recommendations:

The architecture is sound and directly aligns with the PRD. The choice of Zuplo is excellent as it handles the undifferentiated heavy lifting of gateway infrastructure.

**Key Recommendations for Implementation:**
1.  **Database Performance:** Prioritize a low-latency database connection. Choose a database provider and region that is geographically close to your primary user base and Zuplo's infrastructure.
2.  **Asynchronous Writes:** Ensure that database writes (logging usage, deducting credits) are performed *after* the response has been sent to the client, or at least in a non-blocking manner, to avoid adding latency to the request lifecycle.
3.  **Error Handling & Idempotency:** The logic for deducting credits must be idempotent. If a network error occurs during the DB write after a successful call, there needs to be a mechanism to prevent double-charging on a retry. This is critical for billing accuracy.
4.  **Transaction Management:** Group related database operations (e.g., logging and credit deduction) within transactions to ensure data consistency.

This technical plan provides a solid foundation for the development team to begin implementation.
