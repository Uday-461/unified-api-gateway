## 7. Future Scope / Out of Scope for MVP

To ensure a focused initial delivery, the following features from the PRD are explicitly out of scope for the core API gateway and database implementation. They will be handled by a separate web application or addressed in a future phase.

-   **Payment Provider Integration:** The purchasing of credits is a critical feature but will be implemented within the Developer/Consumer Portal web application. For the MVP, credits can be added directly to the database for testing purposes.
-   **User Interface for Management:** The creation of API keys, registration of servers, and management of user accounts will be handled by the web application. Initial testing of the gateway will be done via direct database manipulation and API calls.
-   **Email Notifications:** All automated email notifications (low balance, downtime, etc.) are deferred to a future phase.
